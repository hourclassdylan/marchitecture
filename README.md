# What is Marchitecture?

Maybe marchitecture is what happens when we all need to throw 100 logos on a map depicting whatever new hype-y craze is taking the VC world by storm. Maybe it is what you ask your chief of staff to put together when investors keep asking about your competition. Maybe it's neither. Maybe it's both.

All I know is that this work is incredibly redundant, and there IS a better way.

By taking the best practices of open source, we can all come together to build one market map to rule them all.

Also please go easy as this is the first thing I have ever built, and it was 100% with the heavy lift of AI ghostwriters ;)
